                <p>The genius of Parrot66 is in the patent pending process that allows us to use everyday bilinguals to evaluate language skills.  After all, our consumer base is typically not a bunch of language experts, but the billions of simply native or bilingual people that prefer to communicate in a language other than English. Parrot66 is the only language certification in the market, by the people, for the people!  To get started working as a Parrot Rater, will need to be at least 18 years old and have scored an ILR 3 on the Parrot test (top score on the scale).  Once you have done this, you will be put through an online training/certification process and will then be on your way to helping fuel the movement to empower true bilinguals!</p>
